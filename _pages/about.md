Avid Rust fanboy until something else grabs my interest and occasional wannabe hacker. I enjoy boxing, snowboarding, climbing, learning new technologies and spending hours on my [dotfiles](https://github.com/nikofil/dotfiles). I like breaking things more than fixing them.

This blog is for whenever I'm working on something that I consider might be interesting / I just want to write words about.

Currently working for CERN's Computer Security Team, primarily on the infrastructure that scans the network and alerts users for issues.
